OBJECTIVE:
Optimize the sequential NLP models to achieve the following performance hierarchy:
LSTM Model > RNN Model > Dense Model

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Model Performance:
   - Implement and train three neural network architectures: LSTM, RNN, and Dense
   - Ensure LSTM consistently outperforms RNN, which outperforms Dense
   - Optimize hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, epochs, layer sizes, dropout, etc.)
   - Use appropriate evaluation metrics (accuracy, loss, F1-score, etc.)

2. Reproducibility & Validation:
   - Set random seeds (NumPy, TensorFlow, Python) for deterministic results
   - Run the complete training pipeline 2-3 times independently
   - Compare results across runs to ensure consistency and statistical significance
   - Document performance metrics for each run

3. Implementation Flexibility:
   - You may adjust hyperparameters, network architecture, and training strategies
   - You may modify or augment the dataset if needed
   - You may incorporate additional data sources or preprocessing techniques
   - You may implement early stopping, learning rate scheduling, or other optimization strategies

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- LSTM performance > RNN performance > Dense performance (across all test runs)
- Results are reproducible and consistent when code is run multiple times
- Clear performance metrics and comparison results documented
- Code is optimized and efficient

DELIVERABLES:
- Working Python script with all three models
- Reproducible results showing performance comparison
- Validation report confirming results across multiple runs
